Welcome ðŸ‘‹

This is the GitHub Account of the Fach- und Koordinationsstelle OGD Basel-Landschaft. Our unit is tasked with managing and updating the Open Government Data (OGD) catalog and operating the central OGD portal (data.bl.ch), encompassing all relevant cantonal data sets. We coordinate data preparation across various departments and provide advisory services on professional data management processes. Additionally, we represent OGD at conferences and events, communicate updates, respond to inquiries, and engage with the community for the development of OGD.

With this account, we share code and documents that we use in our daily work and that may be of interest to the community and external parties.
